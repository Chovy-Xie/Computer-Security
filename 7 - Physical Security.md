# Physical Security

Some specific physical items:
 - Data/File servers
 - Media security 
	- Electronic backups
	- Paperwork with sensitive info
	- Media sanitization / reuse / disposal
 - Network switching / transmission equipment
 
Area/design considerations:
 - Availability: Power (UPS), connectivity (physical network wiring, multi-homing, ...)
 - Zoning: Secure facilities layer access areas by clearance
 - Electronic emanations: Servers at core of building make it harder to monitor RF leakage (also TEMPEST certification)
 - Sound emanations 


## User Authentication

Three basic types of authentication(认证):
 - Something you have
 - Something you know
 - Something you are 
 
Multi-factor authentication combines multiple techniques
 - Common usage: "two-factor authentication" or 2FA
	- Supported by almost all online services, banks, etc. ... and UNCG

Common access controls: 
 - Keyed locks: sth you have
 - Combination locks: sth you know 
 - Cards with magnetic stripes: sth you have 
 - Cards that require a PIN: sth you have and sth you know (2FA)
 - Fingerprint scanners on computers/phones: sth you are
